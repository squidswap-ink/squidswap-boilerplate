We are building a boilerplate for Next.js + Ethers.js + App Router. We use @inkonchain/ink-kit for the UI components and theming. 

Build this so the most novice user could git clone and edit the build.

Formulate sections that are easily editable by someone who has never known to code, include good comments to explain what is happening.
