# Building Web3 Applications with SquidSwap's Next.js Boilerplate v0.0.1

In the ever-evolving landscape of Web3 development, getting started can be overwhelming. Today, I'm excited to share SquidSwap's powerful yet beginner-friendly boilerplate (v0.0.1) that combines Next.js, Ink Kit (by Inkonchain), and Kraken Wallet integration. This setup provides everything you need to start building decentralized applications (dApps) with a beautiful, modern interface.

## What's Inside the Box? ðŸ“¦

Our boilerplate comes packed with:

- **Next.js App Router**: The latest and greatest from the Next.js ecosystem
- **@inkonchain/ink-kit**: A beautiful UI component library with built-in theming
- **Ethers.js**: The most popular Ethereum library for interaction with the blockchain
- **Kraken Wallet Integration**: Pre-configured wallet connection
- **Reown**: For efficient state management
- **SquidSwap Token Integration**: Ready-to-use token utility infrastructure

## About SquidSwap Integration ðŸ¦‘

This boilerplate is part of the SquidSwap ecosystem, currently at version 0.0.1. As the platform evolves, this boilerplate will be continuously updated with new features and improvements. Future versions will include:

- Enhanced token utility features
- Advanced DEX integration capabilities
- Expanded cross-chain functionality
- Additional wallet support
- Improved developer tools and documentation

### Token Utility Integration

The boilerplate comes pre-configured for token utility integration, making it easy to:

1. Implement token-gated features
2. Handle token transactions
3. Display token balances
4. Integrate with SquidSwap's liquidity pools
5. Implement token swapping functionality

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-project-name
pnpm install
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your environment variables.

### Step 2: Understanding the Structure

Our boilerplate follows a clean, intuitive structure:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/             # Next.js App Router pages
â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ context/        # Global state management
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # Custom React hooks
â””â”€â”€ styles/         # Global styles and themes
```

### Step 3: Key Features

#### Wallet Connection
The boilerplate comes with a pre-built `ConnectButton` component that handles wallet connection. It's preconfigured to work with Kraken Wallet by default but can be easily extended to support other wallets.

#### Token Integration
The boilerplate includes built-in support for token utility features. You can easily:
- Connect to SquidSwap's token contracts
- Implement token-gated access
- Handle token transfers and approvals
- Display token balances and transaction history

### Setting Up Reown Wallet Integration

1. Sign up for an account at [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com)
2. After signing up, you'll receive a unique Project ID
3. In your `.env` file, add your Reown Project ID:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   ```
4. The boilerplate is now configured to use Reown for wallet integration, providing a seamless experience for connecting to various wallets, including Kraken Wallet.

Remember to never commit your `.env` file to version control to keep your Project ID secure.


#### Theming
Thanks to Ink Kit, you get a beautiful, consistent design system out of the box. The theme can be customized in the `theme` configuration file.

#### State Management
We use Reown for state management, providing a simple yet powerful way to handle application state. The setup is minimal and easy to extend.

## Customization Guide ðŸŽ¨

### Modifying the Theme
Navigate to your theme configuration and adjust colors, spacing, and other design tokens. Ink Kit makes it simple to maintain consistency across your application.

### Adding New Pages
Create new pages in the `app` directory. The App Router's file-system based routing makes it intuitive to add new routes.

### Connecting to Smart Contracts
The boilerplate includes examples of connecting to smart contracts using Ethers.js. Simply update the contract addresses and ABIs in the `contracts` directory.

## Best Practices ðŸŒŸ

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for sensitive information
2. **Component Organization**: Keep components small and focused
3. **Error Handling**: Utilize the built-in error boundaries and wallet connection error handling
4. **Responsive Design**: Take advantage of Ink Kit's responsive components

## Common Customizations

### Changing the Default Wallet
While Kraken Wallet is set as the default, you can easily add support for other wallets by modifying the wallet configuration in the context provider.

### Adding New Features
The boilerplate is structured to make adding new features straightforward. Each feature typically involves:
1. Creating new components in the `components` directory
2. Adding any necessary hooks in the `hooks` directory
3. Updating the global state in the context if needed

## Future Development ðŸ”®

As this is version 0.0.1 of the boilerplate, users can expect regular updates and improvements. The SquidSwap team is actively working on:

1. Enhanced DEX integration tools
2. More sophisticated token utility features
3. Advanced cross-chain compatibility
4. Improved documentation and examples
5. Additional UI components and templates

Stay tuned to our GitHub repository for updates and new releases!

## Deployment ðŸš€

The boilerplate is optimized for deployment on Vercel, but can be deployed anywhere that supports Next.js applications. Simply connect your repository to your preferred hosting platform and deploy!

## Conclusion

This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building Web3 applications, whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer. The combination of Next.js, Ink Kit, and Kraken Wallet integration gives you everything you need to start building professional-grade dApps.

Remember, the key to successful development is understanding each piece of the puzzle. Take time to explore the codebase, read the comments, and don't hesitate to modify things to suit your needs.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
